# OmgLang
OmgLang is a prototype for a natively multi-treaded language.

For most programming languages single core programming is the norm. And going out to multi treaded is a world only traveled by the brave. I want to try to create a programming langue where multi core is the norm and single core is the wired edge case.

## Goals

1. Lean about creating programming languages.
2. Create a prototype to see if its possible to create a useable language that have no shared mutable state.
3. Play around with different ways to handle concurrency.
4. Setup the framework to create a more serious version called hydra.

## None goals
* Performance this will be a simple interpreted language.
* New sexy syntax. Will look like JavaScript and Python.
* Feature completeness. I plan to write software in this language but it will not be for general consumption. I plan to just add features to the language/ stander library as needed by me.
